      <h3>💡Solved: Fixing Lenovo ThinkPad Touchscreen Issues (The Registry Fix)</h3>
	  <p><strong>Date:</strong> 2025-11-19</p>
      <p>If you're supporting Lenovo ThinkPad Gen4 (or similar) laptops and suddenly the touchscreen stops responding for a specific user, you're not alone. The usual suspects—drivers and BIOS settings—often don't fix it.

Through a structured troubleshooting process, I discovered this is often caused by corrupt or misconfigured user-specific touch and pen calibration settings stored in the Windows Registry.

Here is the step-by-step fix that resolved the issue.</p>
      <p> <b>⚠️Important Warning
-You are editing the Windows Registry. Always back up the registry first (File > Export) before proceeding.</b></p>

		<h5>⚙️The Simple Steps:</h5>
		<p>Step 1: Open the Registry Editor
			Press the Windows Key + R, type regedit, and hit Enter.</p>
		<p>Step 2: Reset Touch and Pen Calibration</p>
			<p>-Navigate to: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\ </p>

			<p>-Find the folder (key) named Wisp.</p>

			<p>-Right-click the Wisp key and choose Rename.</p>

			<p>-Rename it to Wisp.old. (Windows will create a new, clean one automatically).</p>
		<p>Step 3: Clean Up Optional Settings</p>
			<p>While still in the HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\ path, look for the following two keys:</p>
				<p>-TouchPrediction (If you see it, right-click and Delete it).</p>
				<p>-TabletTip (If you see it, right-click and Rename it to TabletTip.old).</p>
		<p>Step 4: Restart</p>
			<p>Restart the computer. When the affected user logs back in, the system will generate fresh, non-corrupt touch settings, and your touchscreen should be working again!</p>

	<h3> 💻 Digital Exam Timer Project (School Exam Display)</h3>
	<p><strong>Date:</strong> 2025-11-19</p>
	<p>Our school needed a reliable digital exam timer for VCE, year-level exams, and general assessments. Unfortunately, the original timer files were lost, so I undertook a project to recreate it with modern functionality.</p>
	
	<h5>🛠️ Rebuilding the Timer</h5>
	<p>I rebuilt the timer using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This approach ensures maximum compatibility, allowing the timer to run easily on any browser, classroom TV, projector, or PC.</p>
	<p><b>Key Development Steps:</p></b>
		<p>-Designed Layout: Focused on large, bold text and school colors for maximum visibility.</p>
		<p>-JavaScript Logic: Implemented robust countdown logic and an end-of-time alert.</p>
		<p>-Full Screen: Optimized the design for a clean, distraction-free full-screen view.</p>
	
	<p><b> ⭐ Timer Features </p></b>
		<p>This version is designed to be simple, reliable, and versatile:</p>
			<p>-Large Digital Clock: Highly visible countdown display.</p>
			<p>-Controls: Simple Start/Pause/Reset functionality.</p>
			<p>-Custom Duration: Easy input for any exam length.</p>
			<p>-Alerts: Auto "Time's Up" message when the countdown finishes.</p>
			<p>-Versatile: Works offline and is responsive on all screen sizes.</p>
	<p><b>📥 Download the HTML Version </b></p>
		<p>The full working version, including the source code, is available for download and reuse:</p>
			<p>👉 Digital Exam Timer (HTML)</p>
				<p>-The download includes index.html, script.js, and style.css.</p>
